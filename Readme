# Usable masks as items

This script is created by i-kulgu (https://github.com/i-kulgu/ik-masks)
It's configurable so you can add a new mask from config.

# Add new mask

Go to config.lua and add a new mask like:

["mask3"] = { -- must be unique
    maskId = 13, -- the id number from your clothing
},

Add an item in your database with the unique itemname you created in config.
